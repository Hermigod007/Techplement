Collaborated with Team Py 06 to develop a command-line utility as part of a collaborative project. Leveraging
Pythonâ€™s argparse module, we created a versatile tool capable of performing tasks such as file compression and
text manipulation. Responsibilities included contributing to the design and implementation of the utility, as
well as writing efficient and user-friendly scripts to execute its functionality.
